Step 1: Configure the AWS CLI
This is the main command you will use to connect your local machine to your AWS account. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

Bash

aws configure
The command will then prompt you for four pieces of information one by one.

Step 2: Provide Your Credentials and Configuration
AWS Access Key ID [None]:

Paste the Access Key ID you saved from the IAM user creation step and press Enter.

AWS Secret Access Key [None]:

Paste the Secret Access Key you saved and press Enter.

Default region name [None]:

Enter the region you want to work in by default (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2). This saves you from having to specify the region in every command. Press Enter.

Default output format [None]:

This determines how results are displayed. The most common formats are json (default), text, and table. You can just press Enter to accept the default, or type json and press Enter.

After you complete these steps, the AWS CLI will save your credentials in a configuration file on your computer, and you will be connected.

Step 3: Verify the Connection
To make sure everything is working, you can run a simple command to get information about your identity.

Bash

aws sts get-caller-identity
If the connection is successful, this command will return your Account ID, User ID, and the ARN of the IAM user you configured, confirming that you are successfully connected to your AWS account.
