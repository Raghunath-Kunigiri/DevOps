Spending today revising some core AWS automation concepts, and I wanted to share my notes for anyone who might be working through these topics or feeling stuck. It‚Äôs always great to go back to the fundamentals!

If you're preparing for a DevOps role or just trying to master Infrastructure as Code, here‚Äôs a breakdown of the different ways to provision an EC2 instance, along with common pitfalls and solutions.

---

**1. Revisiting the AWS CLI ‚öôÔ∏è**

This is the ground level. Manually creating resources step-by-step is the best way to understand what automation tools are doing under the hood.

* **Key Commands:** `create-key-pair`, `create-security-group`, `authorize-security-group-ingress`, and `run-instances`.
* **Struggling with this?** The most common issues are usually incorrect permissions on your `.pem` file or a security group rule that isn't configured correctly.

---

**2. Debugging CloudFormation Templates üìú**

CloudFormation is powerful, but its error messages can be tricky. I spent time deliberately recreating common failures to solidify my debugging skills.

* **Struggling with `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`?**
    * Check the **Events** tab! The reason is always there.
    * `"Resource already exists"`: This often means a previous failed stack left a resource behind (like a security group). You need to delete the old resource manually.
    * `"Parameter validation failed"`: This means you're passing an invalid value (like a non-existent KeyPair or VPC ID) when launching the stack. Always use the dropdowns in the console to select valid resources.

**3. Building a Robust Boto3 Script üêç**

Finally, I refined a Python script to automate the entire process. The goal isn't just to make it work once, but to make it **idempotent** (runnable multiple times without errors).

* **Struggling with script errors?**
    * `InvalidKeyPair.Duplicate`: Your script should check if a key pair or security group already exists before trying to create it.
    * `InvalidAMIID.NotFound`: Don't hard-code AMI IDs! They are region-specific. Use the AWS SSM Parameter Store to dynamically fetch the latest AMI ID for your target region.
